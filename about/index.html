<p>About Naomi</p>
<p>I'm a senior at the University of California, Davis studying Computer Science. My main coursework includes Operating Systems, Artificial Intelligence, Programming Languages, and Computer Science Theory</p>
<p>I'm a very friendly person and I love to work with others! In my spare time I read, hike, roller skate, and teach my dog (who still acts like a puppy) new tricks</p>
